# What is this Website about?

Of course me. However not that personal.

Recently I started to suffer from being non-existent on the web in spite of
building web based systems since 1999 for my clients. To solve this problem,
I decided to work for myself and build this website.

On this website, I will publish fun projects that I make freely available as
open source software.

The first project is coming in a few days as
[Trello Gate](https://trello.com/b/XIT6cqZx/trello-gate), a tool for exporting
from and importing to [Trello](http://trello.com/) to and from various formats
and also services such as Asana.

The first release is on the way and will be public in the next few days. This
first version will have CSV, XML and JSON export of the selected boards and it
will allow some customizations such as selecting included data.

After the release of this first project, I will spend some time on this website
so I can provide a common place to access all the coming projects.
