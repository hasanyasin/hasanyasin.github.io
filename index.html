<p>Before anything else, I am proud father of a genius son.</p>
<p>I design and develop software alone or with teams of various sizes. I am
specialized in user experience design and my rare ability is to understand the
user better than the user does.</p>
<p>After working for years professionally on private projects, I have recently
started to invest some time on my online presence which literally didn&#39;t exist.</p>
<p>This website will be a showcase of my work. You can share your ideas or report
problems you face in my projects using github issues.</p>
